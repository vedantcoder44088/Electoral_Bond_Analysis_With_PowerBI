## Introduction

The Electoral Bonds Data Analysis Dashboard provides insights into the transactions of electoral bonds. It includes:
- Total amount of bonds purchased and redeemed.
- Breakdown of bond purchasers.
- Redemption analysis by political party.

## Data

The project uses two primary datasets:
1. **Donors Data**: Information about bond purchasers.
2. **Receiver Data**: Information about bond redemptions by political parties.

## Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vedantcoder44088/Electoral_Bond_Analysis_With_PowerBI.git
   cd Electoral_Bond_Analysis_With_PowerBI
   ```

2. Make sure you have Power BI installed to view the dashboard.

## Usage

1. Place the `donors_data.xlsx` and `redemption_data.xlsx` files in the project directory.
2. Run the data analysis script:
   ```bash
   python Electoral_Bond_Analysis.py
   ```
3. Open the Power BI dashboard file (`electoral_bonds_dashboard.pbix`) to view the visualizations.
